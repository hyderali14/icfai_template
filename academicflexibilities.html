<h2>Academic Flexibilities:</h2>
 </div>
 <br>
 <div class="container0">
   <p>
  The admission policy and the educational process
  at IcfaiTech allow several academic flexibilities.
  Wherever flexibility is possible according to
  the Academic Regulations of the Institute, the
  implementation of the decision invariably takes
  place along with registration at the beginning
  of a semester for the continuing students. As in
  the admission process, the decision is guided by
  the principle of merit, preferences and facilities
  available. We list below the academic flexibilities
  that the students are entitled to in IcfaiTech.
  <br><br>
  <strong>1. Program Transfer (Within the same tier)</strong><br>

  It is possible for a student to seek transfer from
  one program to another in the middle of a program
  without starting from the beginning. This is possible
  because he/she is given credit for what he/she has
  done till then towards the requirements of the
  program to which he/she seeks the transfer. For
  details please refer Student Handbook.
  Since admission to a program is done on assigned
  and competitive basis, there cannot be any scope of
  undoing the fact of an assigned admission through
  transfer. Thus only exceptionally meritorious
  students in a limited number of cases can expect
  to compete for transfer to a more sought-after
  program. On the other hand, transfer to a less
  sought-after program for a student who is unable
  to cope with the rigours of the program in which
  he/she has been admitted would be readily used to
  rehabilitate him/her without much loss of time. In
  any event, transfer must be treated as an admission
  process.<br><br>
  <strong>2. Dual Degree Programs</strong> <br>
  IcfaiTech offers a host of dual degree possibilities for
  the students.
  The dual degree program in Basic Sciences and
  Engineering is an innovative program being offered
  for the first time in India. The student is presented
  with a unique opportunity to earn an engineering
  degree by spending two extra years after the regular
  B.Sc term of three years. The student also has the
  choice of opting out of the dual degree program at
  the end of the second year and can exit after three
  years by earning a B.Sc degree. This dual degree
  Academic Flexibilities
  will also enable hitherto neglected basic sciences
  students to bounce back and will create a balance
  in the science and engineering education scenario in
  the country.
  The other possibility that exists in IcfaiTech is that
  of a dual degree in engineering programs. That is,
  the student can earn two B.Tech degrees in 5 years.
  This is possible since the curriculum for the first two
  years of all the integrated first degree programs is
  same. The number of such seats are limited.
  <br><br>
  <strong>3. Individual Centric Timetable and
  Choice of Instructors</strong><br>
  IcfaiTech has been a pioneer in introducing
  innovative academic practices in the country. One
  such innovative practice that has existed since
  IcfaiTech’s inception in 2002 is that of individualised
  time table. In most of the academic institutions
  the time table for the students is fixed by the
  administration and the students have to follow it.
  In IcfaiTech the students can decide their own time
  table. This works in the following manner. Consider
  a course X which is a common course, i.e. it is a
  course that is taught to students of all the branches
  of engineering. Usually the first two years of all the
  integrated first degree programs at IcfaiTech consist
  of common courses. The student strength is broken
  up into several sections. Each section is handled
  by a different instructor. This is called the team of
  instructors for the common course X. This team of
  instructors is decided upon by the institution and
  declared at the time of registration. The student
  can then choose which instructor’s classes, for the
  common course X, he/she wants to attend. Similarly
  instructors are declared for other common courses
  and the student can choose. This process creates a
  unique individualistic time table for the student.
  <br><br>
  <strong>4. Choice Based Credit System</strong><br>
  IcfaiTech was one of the earliest engineering
  institutions to adopt and implement the choice
  based credit system in the country. The students
  are given the choice of choosing what courses they
  would like to study. The courses are offered in the
  form of electives. The students can choose electives
  which are interdisciplinary and need not be the
  electives of their own program. For example a
  student of Computer Science can choose an elective
  that is offered in Electrical and Communications
  14 IcfaiTech ViewBook 2020
  Engineering or for that matter Data Science or
  Mechatronics. This choice of electives is possible
  as long as the student satisfies the appropriate
  prerequisite conditions if any, for that course.
  <br><br>
  <strong>5. Audit Courses </strong><br>
  There are certain courses amongst the offering
  of the University which are neither part of
  programs nor are available through electives.
  Any student who wish to pursue such courses
  can do so on audit basis on payment of additional
  fee. The facility of pursuing a course on audit is
  principally conceived to give an opportunity to a
  student to update his/her knowledge.
  <br><br>
  <strong>6. Optional Electives</strong><br>
  Apart from the prescribed number of electives
  as a part of the curriculum, IcfaiTech also allows
  students to register for up to four additional
  electives. These electives chosen can be such
  that they enable the students to gain additional
  knowledge in a specialized subject over and
  above the electives that they have chosen. These
  optional Electives are not a part of courses
  required for graduation.
  <br><br>
  <strong>7. Departure From Normal Pace</strong><br>
  The academic structure followed at IcfaiTech
  enables a student to deviate from the normal
  pace of the program into which they have been
  admitted. That is the tenure of the student at the
  Institute may be reduced or increased depending
  on the academics student.
  For further details and exact mechanism of this
  process, please refer the Student Handbook.
  <br><br>
  <strong>8. Other Flexibilities</strong><br>
  The structure of degree programs and the
  academic regulations, provided in the Student
  Handbook, also specify certain other flexibilities
  like repetition of courses, withdrawal from or
  substitution of course(s), etc.
